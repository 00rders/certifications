01 â€” Gap Analysis & Baseline Security  
ðŸ§© Scenario

While listening to Professor Messerâ€™s video on gap analysis and baselines (during stealth mode at work), I focused on understanding how organizations compare their current security posture with desired benchmarks. I also learned how baselines are built from people and protocols, especially to prevent social engineering threats.

ðŸ”§ What I Did

Passively listened to the full video on the sales floor.
Logged mental checkpoints without breaking work flow.
Captured key takeaways about gap analysis methodology and baseline structure.
Reflected afterward using an AI-assisted quiz (6/6 score).
ðŸ§  What I Learned

Gap analysis helps identify security weaknesses by comparing current state vs. ideal standards.
Baselines are constructed from:
- People (staff behaviors, access levels)
- Protocols (standard procedures and training)
Baselines help standardize defense â€” especially against non-technical threats.
These concepts are foundational for compliance audits and risk management.

ðŸ”’ Why It Matters

Gap analysis is a strategy tool in both security planning and compliance prep.
Baseline knowledge is critical in building a defensible, audit-ready security environment.
It helps identify misalignments between policy and reality â€” a key task for SOC analysts or GRC roles.

ðŸ’¼ Real-World Scenario

A new CISO joins a mid-size company and initiates a gap analysis. They find that while MFA is documented in policy, it isnâ€™t enforced on internal email access. Using the baseline protocol documents, they update training and enforcement to align behavior with policy.

ðŸ¤– What Could IRIS Do?

Perform lightweight gap scans between declared policies and actual logs/configs.
Highlight protocol violations (e.g., MFA policy exists but isnâ€™t enforced).
Visualize current vs. baseline postures for fast triage and stakeholder reporting.
