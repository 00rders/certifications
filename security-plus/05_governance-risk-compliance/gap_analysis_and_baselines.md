### 📘 Notes — Gap Analysis and Security Baselines  
**CompTIA Security+ Objective: 5.4 — Summarize risk management processes and concepts**

### 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Gap Analysis**
  - A method of comparing current security posture against a **desired state** (e.g., compliance standard, framework, or policy).
  - Helps identify what **controls are missing** or **underperforming**.
  - Typically done during audits, assessments, or before security overhauls.

- **Security Baseline**
  - A minimum set of required configurations or controls to maintain a **known, secure state**.
  - Can apply to systems, networks, user accounts, or entire departments.
  - Often derived from:
    - Industry frameworks (e.g., NIST, CIS Benchmarks)
    - Internal policies
    - Regulatory requirements

- **Using Baselines + Gap Analysis Together**
  - Baselines define the **target state**
  - Gap analysis identifies what’s **missing or misconfigured**

### 🔐 Why It Matters in Security

- Crucial for **measuring risk** and tracking **compliance readiness**
- Helps prioritize remediation tasks based on **real, measurable deviations**
- Often used during mergers, audits, and after major incidents

### 💼 Real-World SOC Example

> A company adopts the CIS Level 1 benchmark as its server security baseline.  
> During a quarterly audit, a **gap analysis** reveals that 12% of servers are missing critical patches and several still allow outdated protocols.  
> The SOC team escalates patching and disables legacy settings — reducing exposure and restoring baseline compliance.
