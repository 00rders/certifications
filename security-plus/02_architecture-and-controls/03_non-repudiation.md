# 03 â€” Non-Repudiation

## ðŸ§© Context  
Understanding non-repudiation is crucial for verifying the origin and integrity of data in digital communications. It ensures that actions (like sending a message or performing a transaction) cannot later be denied.

## ðŸ”§ What I Learned

- **Non-repudiation** means someone cannot deny having performed an action, such as sending a message or initiating a transaction.
- It's the **digital equivalent of a signed contract** â€” undeniable proof of origin and delivery.
- This is typically enforced using **digital signatures**, where asymmetric encryption and hashing are combined.
- Plays a key role in legal, financial, and security systems where proof of origin is essential.

## ðŸ”’ Why It Matters

- **Security Assurance**: Confirms sender identity and message integrity in critical transactions.
- **Forensic Use**: Enables traceable, auditable records for investigators or security teams.
- **Trust Layer**: Builds confidence in communications, especially across insecure or hostile environments.

## ðŸ›  Real-World Application Scenario  
A SOC analyst receives a tamper-alert for a sensitive internal document. The analyst uses metadata and the digital signature embedded in the file to confirm the document was in fact created by a trusted executive and hasn't been altered. This validation prevents a costly data breach investigation.

## ðŸ¤– What Could IRIS Do?

- **Log signature validations** during file ingestion or alerts, noting verified origin and hash match status.
- **Generate auto-audit logs** when a fileâ€™s digital signature fails validation.
- **Support compliance checks** by scanning stored files for non-signed or altered critical documents.
