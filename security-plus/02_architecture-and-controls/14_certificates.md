## üß† Core Concepts ‚Äì Certificates

- A **digital certificate** is a digitally signed file that:
  - Binds a **public key** to an identity (user, organization, server)
  - Is issued and signed by a **Certificate Authority (CA)**
- Certificates are structured using the **X.509 standard**
- Core components of a certificate:
  - **Subject** ‚Äì who the cert is for
  - **Issuer** ‚Äì who signed it
  - **Public Key** ‚Äì used in encryption/signature verification
  - **Serial Number** ‚Äì unique ID
  - **Validity Period** ‚Äì start/end dates
  - **Signature** ‚Äì CA's signature over the cert's hash

## üèõÔ∏è Trust Models

| Model            | Description                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **CA Model**     | Centralized trust hierarchy (root CA ‚Üí intermediates) |
| **Web of Trust** | Decentralized; users sign each other‚Äôs keys (PGP)     |

## üîê Digital Signatures ‚Äì Clarified

- A **digital signature** is:
  - A hash of the data, encrypted with the **sender‚Äôs private key**
  - Attached to a message or file
- It does **not** encrypt the message itself
- Provides:
  - ‚úÖ **Integrity** ‚Äì the message wasn‚Äôt altered
  - ‚úÖ **Authentication** ‚Äì proves sender owns private key

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak Spot Patched:
> A digital signature **is not the same** as encrypting a message.  
> It encrypts the **hash**, not the message itself ‚Äî so no confidentiality is provided.

## üìâ Certificate Lifecycle + Revocation

| Status        | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| **Valid**     | Within time window, properly signed |
| **Expired**   | Past validity date |
| **Revoked**   | Invalidated early due to compromise, misuse |
| **Self-signed** | Not issued by CA; only trusted if manually added |
| **Broken chain** | Any expired or missing cert in the chain invalidates the whole chain |

**Revocation Check Methods:**
- **CRL (Certificate Revocation List)** ‚Äì Static list
- **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)** ‚Äì Real-time query
- **OCSP Stapling** ‚Äì Server attaches signed OCSP response to speed things up

## üîí Common Use Cases

| Use Case                | Cert Type              |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| HTTPS / Web Security    | TLS/SSL Certificate     |
| Email Signing/Encryption| S/MIME Certificate      |
| Signing Software        | Code Signing Certificate |
| User Auth on VPNs       | Client Certificate       |

## üß™ Real-World SOC Example

> You‚Äôre analyzing a phishing domain and inspect its TLS certificate. It‚Äôs self-signed and not issued by a trusted CA. The chain is broken. This validates the site is likely spoofed and should be blocked.  
> You check CRL/OCSP status and log the incident.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CompTIA Exam Traps to Avoid

- **Digital signatures ‚â† encryption of the message**
- **Self-signed certificates are not inherently bad**, just untrusted by default
- **Code signing ‚â† S/MIME** ‚Äî don‚Äôt mix up certificate types
- **OCSP is for revocation**, not encryption
- **CRL is slower**, OCSP is faster and more dynamic

---

## ‚úÖ You Are Exam-Ready If You Can:

- Explain what a digital certificate does and what it's made of  
- Distinguish **digital signatures** from **encryption**
- Identify when a certificate is invalid or revoked
- Choose the right cert type for HTTPS, email, and software signing
- Understand trust chains and the consequences of a broken chain
- Interpret **Web of Trust** vs **CA model**

**Weak spot resolved**: Code signing ‚â† S/MIME  
**Score**: 9/10 + 3/3 (trap drill)
