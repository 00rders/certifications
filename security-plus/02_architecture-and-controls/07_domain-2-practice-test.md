### ✅ Score Summary

| Question | Topic                        | Result  |
|----------|------------------------------|---------|
| 1        | Zero Trust (Core Concept)    | ✅ Correct |
| 2        | Control Types                | ❌ Missed |
| 3        | Non-Repudiation              | ✅ Correct |
| 4        | AAA — Authorization          | ✅ Correct |
| 5        | CIA Triad — DoS              | ✅ Correct |
| 6        | Integrity via Hashing        | ✅ Correct |
| 7        | Administrative Controls      | ✅ Correct |
| 8        | Digital Signature Limits     | ✅ Correct |
| 9        | Zero Trust Components        | ❌ Missed |
| 10       | Corrective Controls          | ❌ (Right logic, wrong letter) |

**Final Result:** 8/10 — Strong Pass  
> Demonstrated deep conceptual understanding with minor clarification needed on component roles and labeling precision.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways & Notes

- Zero Trust requires **continuous context-based evaluation**; PEP enforces, but **Policy Engine** makes decisions.
- **Control types** must be identified by what enforces them (people, procedures, tech).
- **Non-repudiation** comes from **digital signatures** and **asymmetric encryption**.
- **Authentication ≠ Authorization** — know who vs. what access.
- Hashing = **Integrity**, encryption = **Confidentiality**, signing = **Non-repudiation**.
- Be careful not to confuse **Detective (IDS)** with **Corrective (backup/restore)**.
