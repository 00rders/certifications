# INTRO — Security+ Journey (SY0‑601)

**Operator:** _00rders_  
**Start Date:** 2025‑06‑24  
**Goal:** Achieve CompTIA Security+ certification (SY0‑601), build a modular note system designed to scale into analyst workflows, and begin translating key knowledge into SOC-aligned tooling and automation.

---

## 🎯 Why Security+?

- Establishes a foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts:
  - Attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities  
  - Architecture and design  
  - Implementation strategies  
  - Operations and incident response  
  - Governance, risk management, and compliance
- Enables me to **feed my AI-assisted workflow** structured knowledge — turning each concept into automation logic and detection intelligence.
- Acts as a **credential gateway**, while my workflow system becomes the true differentiator in practical SOC environments.

## 🧠 My Strategy

1. **Blaze through Professor Messer videos** without stopping — absorbing first, dissecting later.
2. Post-video, trigger my learning assistant:
   - `"IRIS, video [#] done."`
   - Receive mapped objectives, key points, weak spots, and automation insights.
3. Document everything in modular `.md` files under the matching domain folder.
4. Gradually transform notes into reusable tooling and workflow logic
5. Track progress visually via Git commits and reflection notes.

## 🧭 Tracker

| Domain | Progress |
|--------|----------|
| Attacks & Threats | ☐ |
| Architecture & Design | ☐ |
| Implementation | ☐ |
| Operations & Incidents | ☐ |
| Governance & Compliance | ☐ |

## 🚧 Notes

- Tone follows a “Blunt + Support” model that adjusts based on energy, output, and confidence.
- Every step is meant to **train both the operator and the system** — a dual-layered learning loop.
- Commit early, commit often. This isn’t busywork — it’s scaffolding for automation, analysis, and growth.
