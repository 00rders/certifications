### 📘 Notes — Virtualization Vulnerabilities  
**CompTIA Security+ Objective: 2.6 — Summarize cloud and virtualization concepts**

### 🧠 Core Concepts

#### 🧱 What Are Virtualization Vulnerabilities?
Virtualization vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the hypervisor, VM isolation, or shared resource controls that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access across virtual environments.

> ⚠️ Virtual machines introduce **new attack surfaces** — especially when multiple VMs share the same physical host.

### 🧬 Key Virtualization Vulnerability Vectors

| Vector                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **VM Escape**             | Malware or exploit inside a VM breaks out and interacts with the host or other VMs |
| **Hypervisor Exploits**   | If the hypervisor is compromised, attacker can control all hosted VMs |
| **Resource Contention**   | One VM monopolizes CPU/memory, causing denial-of-service (DoS) to others |
| **Snapshot Abuse**        | Attackers can restore compromised snapshots if not properly managed |
| **Improper Isolation**    | Misconfigurations allow unintended communication between VMs |

> 🧠 *Hypervisors are high-value targets — especially in cloud or enterprise environments.*

### 🛠️ Risk-Based Response Strategy

| Scenario                          | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Production VM environment**     | Use Type 1 hypervisors with hardened OS and strict access control |
| **Cloud-based VM hosting**        | Review provider's isolation model and monitor shared tenancy risks |
| **Critical infrastructure VM**    | Enable logging, restrict admin API access, disable unnecessary tools |
| **Snapshot use**                  | Audit snapshots regularly, encrypt and sign them |

---

### ⚠️ Why It Matters in Security

- VM escapes can allow **full compromise of host systems** and other virtual machines  
- SOC teams must **monitor hypervisor logs** for anomalies, unexpected inter-VM traffic, or resource spikes  
- Proper segmentation and **least privilege access** are critical when multiple VMs share the same hardware  
- **Cloud environments** add another layer of abstraction, making visibility and trust even more important

### 💼 Real-World SOC Example

> An internal SOC alert is triggered due to excessive CPU usage on a production hypervisor.  
> Investigation reveals one VM was running a malicious process that exploited a known vulnerability to escape its VM sandbox.  
> IRIS parses the logs, identifies lateral movement into a neighboring VM, and auto-generates an incident report with CVE references and recommended containment actions.
