Objective 3.5 — Physical Security Controls  
🧩 Scenario

While studying Security+ implementation topics, I focused on the physical security devices most likely to appear on the exam. My goal was to understand which controls are high-priority for test preparation and to memorize their core function without over-focusing on overly obvious examples (e.g., lighting deters attackers).

🔧 What I Did

🎥 Watched: “Physical Security Controls” by Professor Messer (Security+ SY0-601)  
🎯 Maps to: CompTIA Objective 3.5 – “Implement physical controls to secure assets.”

🧠 What I Learned

These are the physical security controls I prioritized based on exam relevance:

- **Barricades & Bollards**  
  Prevent vehicles from breaching restricted zones.

- **Access Control Vestibules (Mantraps)**  
  One door closes before the next opens — prevents tailgating and unauthorized entry.

- **Alarms & Sensors**  
  Detect motion, door opening, or glass breaking — trigger alerts or lockdowns.

- **Badges, Smart Cards, Biometrics**  
  Used to verify identity and grant access to secure areas.

- **Video Surveillance (CCTV)**  
  Provides visual record of activity — used for real-time monitoring and post-incident review.

- **Key Management**  
  Tracks physical key issuance and limits duplication.

- **Security Guards**  
  Act as active deterrents, monitors, and first responders.

- **Cable Locks & Locking Cabinets**  
  Protect mobile devices, servers, or drives from physical theft.

- **Electronic Door Access Controls**  
  Include keypads, card readers, or biometric scanners — often tied to access logs.

- **Faraday Cages / Shielding**  
  Block electromagnetic signals to protect against wireless eavesdropping or data leakage.

🔒 Why It Matters

Digital security is meaningless if physical assets can be stolen or tampered with. Understanding these controls is critical in roles where incident response or compliance require layered protection — both logical and physical.

💼 Real-World Scenario

An employee gains unauthorized access to a server closet using a cloned badge. The breach was made possible by weak key management and no real-time surveillance. Incident response required reviewing physical logs alongside SIEM alerts — tying physical and digital together.

🤖 What Could IRIS Do?

Cross-reference badge scans and system logins to identify mismatched access.
Alert when physical access occurs outside business hours.
Maintain physical access maps per asset or user group for audits and investigations.
