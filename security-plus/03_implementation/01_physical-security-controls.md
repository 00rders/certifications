### 📘 Notes — Physical Security Controls  
**CompTIA Security+ Objective: 3.4 — Given a scenario, implement physical security controls**

---

### 🧠 Core Concepts

Physical security protects systems, personnel, and data from **physical threats** such as theft, vandalism, unauthorized access, or environmental hazards.

---

#### 🧱 Common Physical Security Controls

- **Perimeter Security**
  - Fencing, gates, signage
  - Designed to deter unauthorized entry

- **Access Control Mechanisms**
  - Security guards, ID badges, key cards, biometrics
  - Controls who can enter specific areas

- **Surveillance**
  - CCTV, motion sensors, security alarms
  - Used for both deterrence and incident investigation

- **Environmental Controls**
  - Fire suppression systems (e.g., sprinklers, halon)
  - HVAC, humidity control, water leak detection
  - Protects equipment from environmental damage

- **Barriers and Locking Systems**
  - Mantraps, turnstiles, safes, locked server racks
  - Enforces one-person-at-a-time entry or secured containment

---

### 🔐 Why It Matters in Security

- No amount of digital security compensates for weak **physical security**
- Many high-profile breaches began with **physical intrusion** (e.g., tailgating, USB drops)
- Physical controls are often the first and last line of defense in defense-in-depth strategies

### 💼 Real-World SOC Example

> A data center uses key card access and mantraps to restrict entry to authorized personnel.  
> A technician attempts to piggyback into the server room.  
> Motion sensors and CCTV record the attempt, triggering a security alert.  
> The SOC analyst correlates this with a suspicious USB device found on the floor the next day.
