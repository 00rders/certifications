# Security+ (SY0-601) Certification Notes

This folder contains my modular study system for the CompTIA Security+ exam. Each subfolder aligns with one of the five official domains from the SY0-601 objectives.

## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| `01_attacks-threats-vulnerabilities/` | Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities |
| `02_architecture-design/` | Architecture and Design |
| `03_implementation/` | Implementation |
| `04_operations-incidents/` | Operations and Incident Response |
| `05_governance-risk-compliance/` | Governance, Risk, and Compliance |

## 🧠 Study Method

- **Watch**: Professor Messer video playlists.
- **Trigger**: IRIS-assisted post-video reflections to extract:
  - Mapped objectives
  - Weak spots
  - Key concepts
  - Automation insights
- **Document**: Structured `.md` notes per domain.
- **Translate**: Real knowledge → tooling and workflow logic.

> This is more than certification prep — it's training data for a future SOC copilot.
