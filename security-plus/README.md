# 🛡️ Security+ (SY0-601) Certification Notes

This repository contains my modular, domain-aligned study system for the **CompTIA Security+** (SY0-601) exam.  
Each folder maps directly to the five official Security+ domains, with structured notes for every major concept.

## 🧠 Study Method

- **Watch** — Professor Messer's SY0-601 video playlist
- **Reflect** — Short post-video takeaways identifying:
  - What clicked
  - What felt forgettable
  - What needs reinforcement
- **Note** — Clean, per-topic `.md` entries with:
  - 🔹 Objective mapping
  - 🔹 Core concepts
  - 🔹 Real-world SOC examples
  - 🔹 No fluff, no filler
- **Repeat** — Continuous mini-reviews and quizzes for retention

## 💡 Why This Exists

> This isn’t just certification prep.  
> It’s structured onboarding for a future **SOC analyst** — and training data for the IRIS copilot project.

All notes are written for real-world application, not rote memorization.
