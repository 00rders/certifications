# Certifications â€” CompTIA Network+ and Security+ Study Notes

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications.  
All notes are structured for clarity, retention, and quick revision, following the same modular style used across my cybersecurity learning roadmap.

## ðŸ“š Structure

Each certification has its own folder and `notes.md` file:

- [`network-plus/notes.md`](network-plus/notes.md)  
  Contains foundational networking concepts, commands, and exam prep insights.

- [`security-plus/notes.md`](security-plus/notes.md)  
  Covers core security principles, threat types, best practices, and scenario breakdowns.

## ðŸ§  Study Method

I'm combining resources like Professor Messer, practice exams, and hands-on labs to prepare for these certifications.  
Each note is structured to be minimal, effective, and practical â€” not just passive studying.

## âœ… Purpose

While these certifications are just a stepping stone, this repo helps:

- Reinforce technical fundamentals alongside my lab-based learning.
- Serve as a quick personal reference during review or job interviews.
- Track and reflect on my learning progression.
